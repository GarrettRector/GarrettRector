# About me
I am currently in high school, attending GSMST (#12 highschool in nation btw)
I enjoy coding and programming in languages such as Python and Java. Python was the first langauge I learned, but I want to explore more languages which are more useful for certain things such as java.

# Current Projects
I am currently working on [Jchat](https://github.com/GarrettRector/JChat), and plan to continue development on [RLAC](https://github.com/GarrettRector/RLAC), but would like to start a C based project whether that is C, C++, or C#. One of my goals in that project would to create a 3d render based solely off the command line.
