## Current Projects and the order of their prioritization
I am currently working on [Jchat](https://github.com/GarrettRector/JChat), and plan to continue development on [RLAC](https://github.com/GarrettRector/RLAC), but would like to start a C based project whether that is C, C++, or C#. One of my goals in that project would to create a 3d render based solely off the command line.
